Machine learning, deep learning and neural networks are fundamentally disrupting practically every business sector across multiple industries in some facet or another. People use and interact with machine learning every day. Outcomes become a touchpoint that has an impact (direct and indirect) in people's lives.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence can go wrong. But how will we know?

What is important to remember: Code is written by humans, data is collected by humans, inputs for the algorithms are decided by humans and that all can be biased or misleading.

Machine learning is a tool like any other of technology. You would not want your computer mouse to decide your credit rating. Neither should machine learning. However, both are tools that are used for such a purpose.

AI learns about how the world has been. It picks up on trends of the status quo -- what once was. It does not know how the world ought to be. That is for humans to decide.
